Hello, I'm On2Me!
Welcome to my GitHub profile — thank you for stopping by. 

I'm a learing Cyber Security Specialist based in Germany with a strong passion for all things security. Whether it's breaking systems to understand how they work or building robust defenses to protect them, I thrive on solving complex challenges and continuously learning in this ever-evolving field. 

Core Expertise  

    Penetration Testing 
    Conducted numerous black-box, white-box, and gray-box assessments across internal networks, web applications, and APIs. Always focused on delivering actionable findings and         practical remediation advice. 

    Security Operations & SIEM 
    Experienced in deploying and maintaining enterprise-grade SIEM solutions (Splunk, ELK Stack) for real-time monitoring, log correlation, threat hunting, and incident detection. 

    Malware Analysis 
    Analyzed various types of malware including ransomware, trojans, and downloaders using tools like Cuckoo Sandbox, IDA Pro, Ghidra, and dynamic analysis environments. 

    Incident Response 
    Responded to multiple real-world incidents involving unauthorized access, data exfiltration attempts, and APT-like behavior. Focused on containment, eradication, recovery, and      post-incident reporting. 

    Network Security 
    Deep hands-on experience working with firewalls (Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, Palo Alto), IDS/IPS systems, VLAN segmentation, and secure network design principles. 
     

Currently Exploring  

    Zero-Day Exploits & Vulnerability Research 
    Actively studying exploit development and reverse engineering to better understand how attackers find and leverage unknown vulnerabilities. 

    Honeypot Networks 
    Designing and managing honeypots and honeynets using tools like Cowrie and Dionaea to gather threat intelligence and observe attacker behavior. 

    Machine Learning in Cybersecurity 
    Experimenting with Python-based ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow) to detect anomalies, classify threats, and automate repetitive tasks in SOC operations. 
     

Notable Projects  

    Custom Penetration Testing Toolkit 
    Built a modular toolkit using Python that automates recon, vulnerability scanning, and payload generation tailored for specific engagement needs. 

    Enterprise SIEM Implementation 
    Led the deployment of a centralized logging and monitoring solution that improved detection capabilities and reduced mean time to respond (MTTR). 

    Web Application Security Scanner 
    Developed an automated scanner that checks for OWASP Top 10 issues, custom logic flaws, and misconfigurations in web apps. 

    Firewall Rule Optimization Tool 
    Created a script to parse and clean legacy firewall rulesets, identifying shadowed, unused, and redundant rules.
